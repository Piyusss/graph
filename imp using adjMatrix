void AdjcencyMatrix(){
    int n,m;

    int adjList[n+1][m+1];
    for(int i=0 ; i<m ; i++){
        int u,v;

The drawback of the adjacency matrix representation is that an adjacency matrix
contains n2 elements, and usually most of them are zero. For this reason, the representation cannot be used if the graph is large.
